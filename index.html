    <H1>OLUWASEUN</H1>
    <p>We met on a Christian dating site on the 21 st of December 2023, and we talked just like casual
friends until one very night when ijeoma called through. She was like she wanted to have a
conversation with me, and I had many things on my mind, putting me through different kinds of
questions about her wanting to know more about me; the call lasted for about 2hrs, and from
there, we concluded on meeting each other one on one and from that moment I felt a deep
connection with her and in my mind I knew this was God sent. From that moment, I am
endlessly grateful to her. I feel complete and understood. Thank you for loving me so profoundly
and making every day unique for us.</p>

            <div class="how-we-met-content center "><h3>BRIDE</h3>
    <H1>IJEOMA</H1>
    <p>With my busy work and school schedules, I had to rely on social media for my social life. I had
just completed my masterâ€™s in nursing and had nothing to distract me from looking for my man.
Of course, I spoke to God about it first by praying and fasting. I told God I wanted a man to help
increase my spiritual growth and draw me closer to him. Many dating sites were suggested to
me, but of course, I chose the Christian dating site. I met Oluwaseun Abayomi on December
21 st, 2023. We talked and quickly shared pictures because I wanted a good-looking man, and he
was. Our talking stage lasted from December to February 14 th , Valentine&#39;s Day, when he
officially asked me to be his girlfriend, and the rest has been a beautiful journey leading to my
dream engagement and wedding.</p></div>

    <h3>HOW HE PROPOSED</h3>
    <h1>Surprise Proposal</h1>
    <div class="proposal-container">
        <div class="proposal-content"><p>Oluwaseun secretly organized an engagement party with my friends and his family. I was totally
in the dark until that very day I walked into the room. I was so much in shock that I did not hear
a single thing he said to me. I just saw that he was down on one knee, and I saw a beautiful
ring. I quickly said yes! because it was straightforward to say. I already knew he was my
husband. I thank God every day for bringing him into my life. Now, we are embarking on a
lifelong journey together just within a year we met. I feel excited and safe about it, knowing that
God is the foundation of it all.</p></div>
